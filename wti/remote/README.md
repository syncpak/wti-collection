# WTI Device  Ansible Modules

This [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) Collection implements a number of
modules for interacting with [WTI Devices](https://wti.com/).

## Installation

Ansible Collections were added as a technology preview in Ansible 2.8,
and are a new method of distributing namespaced Ansible components
that are not integrated into the core source tree.

They can be installed into a playbook-adjacent `collections`
directory, `~/.ansible/collections`, or the system-wide
`/usr/share/ansible/collections`, or you can modify Ansible's
configuration to specify custom locations.

Clone this repo into whichever location strikes your fancy as
`collections/ansible_collections/flowerysong/sensu_go`

## Where's the Documentation?

HTML documentation is not yet being built, but if you have
the collection installed you can access each module's
documentation via the ansible-doc command.
